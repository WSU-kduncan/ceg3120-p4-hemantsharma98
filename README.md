# Project 4 

## Project Overview:
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. It is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
In this Project, I used docker to create image and store it into a container. Moreover, with the help of AWS ECR(Elastic Container Registry) which is a service of AWS I managed to store and deploy that container image.
